# "Aloha Campus" Usability Evaluation Script


## Introduction and Instructions

Hi everyone, today I will be walking you through a usability evaluation of the "Aloha Campus" app.

Let me repeat or clarify what will be happening today. You will all download the "Aloha Campus" app to your phone and will be tasked with completing a series of prompts. The purpose of this evaluation is the test the usability and viability of the app. You as an individual are not being tested.

This session will last between 30-45 minutes, and you may withdraw your consent to participate at any time.

Each task you will be asked to complete corresponds to a feature of the app. As you complete each task, consider how the feature you are using would impact your feeling of connection to UH Manoa. It is ok the think out loud; however, try to not let other's responses impact your own thoughts and feelings about the app.

Both positive and negative is appreciated, as long as it truly encompasses your impression of the app and feature being tested. Do not worry about hurting my feelings by giving negative feedback, this will only serve to improve the app in future development.

## Prelude

Before we start, I will need you all to install the app on your iPhone. First, get out your phone and install the Test Flight app from the app store.

Now that everyone has test flight installed, you should all have just received an invitation to join my user group and install "Aloha Campus". Please accept the invitation and install the app.

For this user evaluation, you will not be making your own accounts. Instead, everyone please use these login credentials to sign in to the app:

Username: jlisoway@hawaii.edu

Password: asdfasdf

After you complete a prompt, you can immediately start recording your answer by walking up to me and telling me your response verbally. I will not continue to the next prompt until everyone has finished the current prompt.

If you have any questions during the test, ask them immediately and I will answer if I can. Are there any questions before we start?

## The Evaluation

I will now give you all the first prompt:

### Prompt 1

Imagine you are a student new to campus and want to find groups to join on campus. You decide to register for the "Aloha Campus" app to do so.

In the app, find a group on campus that you might find interesting. If none interest you, try finding a group that someone you know might like. View its details and join the group. Then, consider if this feature makes you feel more connected to campus life at UH Manoa.


We will now proceed to the second prompt.

### Prompt 2

Imagine are a student that needs to find a group member for two different classes (ICS 691D and ICS 613). It is only the second week of school and you can't remember all of the people in your classes.

In the app, scroll through the classes of the test user and find someone that is taking both ICS 691D and ICS 613. Then, consider if this feature would make it easier for you to form connections with other students?


We will now proceed to the third and final prompt.

### Prompt 3

Imagine you are the leader of a newly founded finance club in Shidler that is looking to recruit freshman and sophomores. The club is called "Future Finance Pros", and members get access to talks with industry professionals and resume/interview guidance. Next month, you are having your first in-person meet and greet.

In the app, create a new group for your finance club. Input all the relevant details and make sure it is publicly visible after creating the club. Then, consider if you believe it will be easier to recruit underclassmen for your finance club by using the app. Do you think this feature makes campus life more lively and accessible?

## Wrap Up

We are now done with the usability evaluation. You may now delete the "Aloha Campus" app and Test Flight app from your phone if you wish. Either way, each of you will be removed from the user testing group and will not have further access to the "Aloha Campus" app. This is to prevent any further manipulation of the backend database during future development.

Thank you everyone for your participation. Does anyone have any final questions, now that we're done?
