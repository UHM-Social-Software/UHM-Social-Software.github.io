## User Goals

- User can register by verifying their email, then sign in using that email.
- Users can edit their public profile image
- Users can edit their public bio
- Users can edit their public interests
- Users can view their enrolled classes
- Users can view their group memberships
- Users can search for students, classes, and groups
- Users can create new groups and edit the details (image, events, description) of that group
- Users can join groups they are not a member of
- Users can view the students of other classes
- Users can view the classes of other students


## Scenarios

- Imagine you are a student new to campus and want to find groups to join on campus. You decide to register for the "Aloha Campus" app. Find a group that you find interesting, view its details and join the group. Successful behavior would include the user either using the explore page or search feature to find new groups to join and viewing at least one group page before successfully joining a new group. As well, successful behavior includes the students ability to register for the app.

- After signing in to the app, you want to change your public profile page. You navigate to the settings page and change your profile picture, interests, and bio to better represent yourself online. Once you makes these changes, you change your mind and want to delete an interest and change a word in your bio. Successful behavior includes successfully uploading a new profile image, and successfully adding/deleting interests, and successfully adding/editing your bio.

- You are a student and needs to find a group member for two different classes (ICS 691D and ICS 613). It is only the second week of school and you can't remember all of the people in your classes. After signing in to the app, you want to see who else is in your ICS 691D class. You scroll the ICS 691D enrollment browsing those student's classes and eventually find someone that is enrolled in both ICS 691D and ICS 613. Now you can message them asking if they want to be in your group for both classes. Successful behavior involves successfully viewing and browsing your own classes, and viewing and browsing multiple other profiles of people you reached from viewing the enrolment of your own classes.

Each scenario description should include both a description of the prompt you will give the user, as well as what would constitute a successful behavior on the part of the user.
