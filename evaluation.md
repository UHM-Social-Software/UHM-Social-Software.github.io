# "Aloha Campus" Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals

- The user is able to find and join groups on campus that they find interesting and this makes them feel more connected to campus life
- The user is able to find people they recognize in their classes, making it easier for the user to form connections with other students
- The user is able to easily form a new public group, making campus life more lively and accessible


## Scenarios

### Scenario 1

Imagine you are a student new to campus and want to find groups to join on campus. You decide to register for the "Aloha Campus" app.

In the app, find a group that you find interesting, view its details, and join the group. Does this feature make you feel more connected to campus life at UHM? 

Successful behavior would include the user either using the explore page or search feature to find new groups to join and viewing at least one group page before successfully joining a new group. By doing so, the user feels that they are more connected to campus life.

### Scenario 2

Imagine are a student that needs to find a group member for two different classes (ICS 691D and ICS 613). It is only the second week of school and you can't remember all of the people in your classes.

In the app, scroll through your classes and find someone that is taking both ICS 691D and ICS 613. Do you think this feature makes it easier for you to form connections with other students?

Successful behavior involves successfully viewing and browsing your own classes and viewing and browsing multiple other profiles of people you reached from viewing the enrolment of your own classes. By doing so, the user finds someone to form a group with and finds it easier, in general, to form connections on campus by using the app.

### Scenario 3

Imagine you are the leader of a newly founded finance club in Shidler that is looking to recruit freshman and sophomores. The club is called "Future Finance Pros", and members get access to talks with industry professionals and resume/interview guidance. Next month, you are having your first in person meet and greet.

In the app, create a new group for your finance club. Input all the relevant details and make sure it is publicly visible after creating the club. Do you believe it will be easier to recruit underclassmen for your finance club by using the app? Do you think this feature makes campus life more lively and accessible?

Successful behavior includes successfully creating the group. By doing so, the user believes it will be easier to spread information about the group and recruit underclassmen to join. Furthermore, the user thinks this using this feature in the app makes campus life more lively and accessible.
