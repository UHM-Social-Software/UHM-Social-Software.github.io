# "Meet Your People" App

## Motivation
The University of Hawaii is lacking a student body directory for making connections on campus.

### The Problem
The University of Hawaii at Manoa has a very diverse student body, with incoming freshman and transfers coming from all over the US and other countries. Combined with many online and hybrid class formats, it can be incredibly difficult for new and current students to meet others in their class or on campus. The only current system implemented to help classmates get in contact with each other is an email list via Laulima; however, names and images are not associated with these emails, and the addresses themselves are often not representative of a students name very well–making the task of contacting someone specific very challenging. Furthermore, there is no central directory for campus clubs or groups. All of these factors that hinder student body connections need to be addressed.

## Goal
The goal of this organization is to implement an app that is easy to use, promotes on campus connections, and increases the quality of the student experience at UH Manoa.

The "Meet Your People" app will allow students to post what classes they are taking, other campus groups/clubs they are part of, and what their interests are. Students will be able to search and explore for groups/clubs (to explore their interests), classes (to see who’s taking a specific class), or a students (to see what classes/groups someone is in and what their interests are). Students will also be able to message other students directly in the app, making it extremely easy to connect with other's in your class or in a group you may want to join.

By making connections on campus more easily, forming study groups, finding new friends, and seeking advice from others that are taking or have taken your class would be more accessible.

## Usage

When you first open the app, you are asked to sign in using your @hawaii.edu login information:

After signing in, you are directed to your profile page, showing your currently enrolled classes or groups (depending on which button is clicked). The classes, groups, and other information shown here depend on the currently logged in user:

Clicking on a class displays the students in that class:

Clicking on a group displays information related to that group:

Navigating using the bottom navigation bar reveals the explore, messages, and settings pages. The explore page initially shows all groups created using the app, but the search feature (not currently implemented) will be able to search groups, students, and classes:

The Messages tab has a rough layout, but is not finalize functional yet:

The settings pages allows students to edit their profile information, or logout (returning the user to the signin page):

On this page, there are links to create groups or view groups that you are the owner of:

## Installation

[Phase-2 Repository](https://github.com/UHM-Social-Software/app/tree/phase-2-mockup)

To run this code, clone the repository to your local machine and invoke 'flutter run' on the app directory. You may also need to first install flutter and get dependencies (this can be done easily with intelliJ). Note: app is currently mocked-up to look best on the XCODE iOS iPhone 14 simulator.

## [Development status](https://github.com/orgs/UHM-Social-Software/projects/1)

Phase-1 and Phase-2 Mockups are now complete. Phase-3 is currently underway, which includes transitioning to Riverpod Providers and continuing the UI development.
